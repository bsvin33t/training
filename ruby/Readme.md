# Index for Introductory Ruby

### Notes

* We plan to teach just enough Ruby to get by in the introductory sections.
* This is baby steps. No TDD etc.
* Encourage use of irb throughout this section to figure something out by trying it.
* Run sessions with minimum input on the language. Get people to poke and prod and figure it out.
* Help everyone get used to looking up popular online resources.
* Experiment with getting everyone onto #ruby-lang so they get used to asking questions.
* Readme is in recommended order of delivery.
